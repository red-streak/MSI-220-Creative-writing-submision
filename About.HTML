With influences ranging from early blues artist, Robert Johnson to rock and roll legend Chuck Berry and hard rock Pioneers AC/DC Connor has a unique style of music. From punchy rock and roll to melodic ballads he is able to bring a room to tears or dance.
Connor has performed in a multitude of places ranging from a small crowd in college, larger crowds at charity nights while performing at local open mic nights.
While his main instrumentation is guitar and vocals he is versatile in other instruments such as keyboard, bass, violin and harmonica 

While being a performer is Connors main focus he is very keen in how technology can be use within music. from using computer based Daw work to utilising a chain of  a vox Tonelab ST, a digitech Jam man express loop pedal, his own custom disphased Distortion through a preamp orange Micro terror before going into a performance amp. He uses this to create his own unique sound
While his live performance sound is very traditional within a blues rock style his production style is varied through different sounds of electro acoustic and electronic music.
His electro acoustic productions show the use of versatility within his own music with styles ranging from soft Ballard songs to punchy electro swung beats
With influences from mid 90s Techno and hardcore to early 2000’s Club land music Connor electronic music takes the focus of “hard and fast” taking influence from artists such as Dj Brisk, Dj Demand and DJ Deano Balistik 
Connor has had the experience of seeing Dj Balistik perform live from back stage giving him the opportunity to see how a professional live Electronic music rave works from behind the scenes. this sparked his affinity for a heavy and fast bass line within his own musical practices
